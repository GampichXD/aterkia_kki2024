# Data Collecting Documentation

This documentation is about how to get the dataset for our Computer Vision Project (whether it's annotated or unannotated):

### Get Dataset From The Internet

#### Roboflow Universe
![Picture](Data-Collect.png)
You can get datasets from **Roboflow Universe**. Just search for the dataset you want and download it. Once you've got it, extract it to your computer.

Click the link to visit the site: [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/)

#### Kaggle

Just like Roboflow Universe, you can search for the dataset you want on **Kaggle** and download it (usually as a CSV file or other formats). After downloading, move it to your computer.

Click here to go to Kaggle: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

#### Open Image Dataset

Another option is **Open Image Dataset**. This one‚Äôs a bit different because you can directly call it from your code before you start training your model.

### Get Your Own Custom Dataset
You can also create your own custom dataset using your camera or another device. If you're going for a custom dataset, it‚Äôll likely be unannotated, so here‚Äôs the step-by-step process to get that:

1. **Capture Images or Videos**
   Use your device (camera, phone, whatever) to capture the images or video you need.

2. **Edit Your Video**
   If you‚Äôre using a video, edit it so that it only contains the objects you want to detect. Cut out all the extra 'spam' scenes.

3. **Go to Roboflow**
   Now, head to **Roboflow** by clicking here: [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)

4. **Sign In or Sign Up**
   Log in to your account, or create one if you don‚Äôt have it yet.

5. **Create Your Workspace**
   First things first, create your workspace. Give it any name you like, choose your plan (if it‚Äôs your first time, pick the **Public Plan**). Once that‚Äôs done, click **Create Workspace**. You can add another email if you‚Äôre working with a team, or skip if you‚Äôre flying solo.

6. **Start a New Project**
   Click on **New Project** to start a fresh project. Give your project a name (e.g., "Ball Detection"), and enter your annotation group name (e.g., "balls"). For this project type, **Object Detection** is what you‚Äôll need for this.
   
   Here's the breakdown in a table format:

| **Option**             | **Description**                                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object Detection**    | Find objects using bounding boxes and track their position.        |
| **Classification**      | Recognize objects and assign labels.                               |
| **Instance Segmentation** | Color in objects to match their exact shape.                        |
| **Keypoint Detection**  | Get the ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù or stickman of an object (and track it too).    |

   Once done, click **Create Public Project**. Your project page will pop up.

7. **Upload Your Files**
   Choose to upload either a file or a folder. If you‚Äôre using a dataset from Roboflow Universe, Kaggle, or another source, you‚Äôll likely be using a folder with your annotated dataset.

8. **Adjust Your FPS**
   Fit the FPS (frames per second) for your video. 
   - **More FPS** = More dataset, higher accuracy for situations in your video.
   - **Less FPS** = Less dataset, but more variety in the situations your model might encounter.
   
   Once you've set your FPS, click **Choose Frame** and wait for it to complete.

9. **Ready for Labeling!**
   Now you‚Äôre all set for data labeling. Time to mark up those images or video frames!

With this guide, you should be all set to collect and prepare your dataset for a computer vision project! üòé Let me know if you need any more help!

By The Way guys, you can download latest our dataset in this link [Aterkia-KKI-2024-Last Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/aterkia-2024/ball_detection-3p0tu/7). Lets enjoy to label images, hehe.
